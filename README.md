The Workout app consists of three screens. The user will select a workout along with their desired difficulty level. Once they are ready, they’ll select the button at the bottom of the page. The button will take them to the second screen, where a timer will be playing. Once the user is complete with the workout, they will select “complete workout” and be taken to the final screen. The final screen will display a message that reads the workout, the time and the difficulty that was selected. The components of this app are the three screens, the timer, the exercise and the difficulty selection features. 


The workout app fulfills the input requirements by having the user select the different exercises as well as a difficulty level. Another input feature is the timer as well as the buttons.
